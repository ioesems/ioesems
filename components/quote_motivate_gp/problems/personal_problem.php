  <h2>Personal Problems & Solutions for Engineering Students</h2>
  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:16px;">
    Every student has unique personal challenges. These struggles may not be visible, but 
    handling them properly is essential for academic and emotional growth.
  </p>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>1. Self-Doubt and Low Confidence</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Many students feel they are not ‚Äúsmart enough‚Äù for engineering.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Remember that effort beats talent. Track small achievements (assignments, projects). 
      Regular practice and asking questions in class slowly build confidence.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>2. Lack of Motivation</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Losing drive during long semesters or after repeated failures.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Break tasks into smaller goals. Reward yourself for completing them. 
      Surround yourself with motivated peers and remind yourself why you chose engineering in the first place.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>3. Poor Time Management</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Balancing classes, labs, assignments, and personal life feels overwhelming.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Use planners or digital apps. Prioritize urgent vs. important tasks. 
      Avoid last-minute preparation by starting small but early.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>4. Physical Health Neglect</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Skipping meals, irregular sleep, and no exercise due to workload.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Maintain at least a basic routine‚Äî7 hours of sleep, balanced meals, and 
      20‚Äì30 mins of daily physical activity. Health supports academic performance.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>5. Overthinking and Stress</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Worrying too much about grades, future jobs, or comparison with others.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Practice mindfulness or meditation. Talk to trusted friends or mentors. 
      Focus on controllable actions rather than imagined outcomes.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>6. Financial Pressure</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Many students feel burdened by limited pocket money or tuition expenses.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Plan a strict monthly budget. Explore part-time tutoring, freelancing, or scholarships. 
      Communicate with family honestly instead of bottling up stress.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="note-box">
    üå± <strong>Reminder:</strong> Personal struggles are part of growth. 
    Handling them with patience, planning, and self-care makes you stronger. 
    If challenges feel overwhelming, consider reaching out to a mentor, counselor, or mental health support system. 
    You are never alone in this journey.
