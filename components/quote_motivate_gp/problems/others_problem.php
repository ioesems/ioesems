  <h2>Other Common Problems & Solutions</h2>
  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:16px;">
    Apart from study, mental, and social issues, engineering students face unique challenges in Nepal. 
    Here are some ‚Äúother‚Äù difficulties and ways to manage them.
  </p>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>1. Hostel and Accommodation Issues</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Overcrowded rooms, lack of privacy, poor food quality, and frequent distractions.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Build a personal routine (earplugs, study hours). Raise concerns collectively to hostel 
      management. If possible, find group housing with like-minded peers.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>2. Internship and Job Uncertainty</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Limited internships and unclear job market after graduation.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Start networking early. Attend seminars, join student clubs, connect with seniors. 
      Use freelancing or personal projects to build your portfolio.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>3. Technology and Resource Gaps</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Not every student has access to modern lab equipment, fast internet, or latest tools.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Utilize open-source software and free online learning resources (MOOCs, GitHub, YouTube). 
      Share notes and collaborate with peers to reduce dependency on unavailable tools.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>4. Rural vs. Urban Opportunity Gap</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Students from rural areas often lack exposure compared to urban peers.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Leverage digital platforms to access equal learning. Participate in online competitions, 
      coding challenges, and remote workshops to bridge the gap.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>5. Frequent Strikes and Unstable Academic Calendar</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Political strikes (bandh) and system delays often disrupt academic schedules.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Use breaks productively‚Äîrevise subjects, explore side projects, or strengthen soft skills. 
      Stay updated with official notices and adapt flexibly.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>6. Career Path Confusion</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Unsure whether to go for government jobs, private companies, research, or abroad studies.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Seek mentorship from seniors and professors. Research each path (scope, income, growth). 
      Write down long-term goals and compare options realistically.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>7. Financial Burden of Materials and Projects</h3>
    <div class="solution">
      <strong>Problem:</strong> Buying expensive books, equipment, or funding final-year projects.<br>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Share resources among friends, look for second-hand materials, or apply for university 
      project funding. Collaborate in teams to reduce costs.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="note-box">
    üåç <strong>Reminder:</strong> These ‚Äúother‚Äù challenges may not always be visible, but they shape your academic 
    and personal journey. Facing them with adaptability, teamwork, and proactive planning will help you succeed in the long run.
