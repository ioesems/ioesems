Higher resolution DACs can produce more precise analog outputs but are more complex and expensive. The choice of DAC depends on the specific application requirements. Common DAC architectures include binary-weighted resistor, R-2R ladder, and sigma-delta. In many applications, DAC is used in conjunction with ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) to create a complete digital interface with the analog world.

The specific details would need to be adapted based on the actual case study. The key is to clearly explain the existing control mechanism, propose specific and justified improvements, articulate the business case for the improvements, and honestly address potential challenges with mitigation strategies. The recommendation should leverage modern technologies while being practical and cost-effective for the specific application. The implementation should be planned carefully to minimize disruption and ensure a positive return on investment.',
